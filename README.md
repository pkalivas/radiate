Radiate is a powerful Rust library designed for implementing genetic algorithms and artificial evolution techniques. It
provides a fast and flexible framework for creating, evolving, and optimizing solutions to complex problems using principles
inspired by natural selection and genetics. With an intuitive, 'plug and play' style API, Radiate allows you to quickly test a multitude of evolutionary strategies and configurations.

<!-- ## Examples

The radiate-examples directory contains several examples demonstrating the capabilities of the library, including:

* **[Min-Sum](https://github.com/pkalivas/radiate/blob/master/radiate-examples/min-sum/src/main.rs)**: An example of
  minimizing a sum of integers.
* **[N-Queens](https://github.com/pkalivas/radiate/blob/master/radiate-examples/nqueens/src/main.rs)**: A classic
  problem in which the goal is to place N queens on a chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
* **[Knapsack](https://github.com/pkalivas/radiate/blob/master/radiate-examples/knapsack/src/main.rs)**: Another classic
  problem for evolutionary algorithms.
* **[Regression Graph](https://github.com/pkalivas/radiate/blob/master/radiate-examples/regression-graph/src/main.rs)**:
  Evolve a ```Graph<f32>``` (essentially a graph based neural network) for regression analysis.
*
    *

*[Simple Memory Graph](https://github.com/pkalivas/radiate/blob/master/radiate-examples/simple-memory-graph/src/main.rs)
**: Evolve a ```Graph<f32>``` (Neural Network) using recurrent connections for Neural Network based memory.

* **[XOR Graph](https://github.com/pkalivas/radiate/blob/master/radiate-examples/xor-graph/src/main.rs)**: Evolve a
  ```Graph<f32>``` to solve the classic [XOR problem](https://dev.to/jbahire/demystifying-the-xor-problem-1blk). -->
