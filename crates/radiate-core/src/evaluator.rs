//! # Fitness Evaluators
//!
//! This module provides fitness evaluation strategies for genetic algorithms, offering
//! both individual and batch evaluation approaches. Evaluators are responsible for
//! computing fitness scores for individuals in the population using the provided problem.
//!
//! The module provides two main evaluation strategies:
//! - **FitnessEvaluator**: Evaluates individuals one at a time
//! - **BatchFitnessEvaluator**: Evaluates individuals in batches for better performance
//!
//! Both evaluators support parallel execution through the executor system and integrate
//! seamlessly with the ecosystem and problem abstractions.

/// A trait for evaluating fitness of individuals in a genetic algorithm ecosystem.
///
/// The [Evaluator] trait defines the interface for fitness evaluation strategies.
/// Implementors can define different approaches to computing fitness scores,
/// such as individual evaluation, batch evaluation, or specialized evaluation
/// strategies for specific problem domains.
///
/// # Generic Parameters
/// - `C`: The chromosome type that represents the genetic material
/// - `T`: The target type that the problem operates on
pub trait Evaluator<C: Chromosome, T>: Send + Sync {
    /// Evaluates the fitness of unevaluated individuals in the ecosystem.
    ///
    /// This method processes individuals that don't have fitness scores yet,
    /// evaluates them using the provided problem, and updates the ecosystem
    /// with the computed scores.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `ecosystem` - The genetic algorithm ecosystem containing the population
    /// * `problem` - The problem instance used to evaluate fitness

///
/// - **Individual Processing**: Each individual is evaluated separately
/// - **Parallelization**: Can utilize multiple threads through the executor
/// - **Flexibility**: Easy to implement custom evaluation logic

///
/// # Performance Characteristics
///
/// - **Batch Processing**: Multiple individuals evaluated together
/// - **Reduced Overhead**: Sometimes lower per-individual evaluation cost
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// Use [BatchFitnessEvaluator] when:
/// - The problem supports efficient batch evaluation
/// - You have a large population that benefits from parallelization
/// - Individual evaluation overhead is significant
/// - You need access to parts or the whole of an unevaluated population in order to compute fitness.

/// # Batch Size Calculation
///
/// In order to ensure the optimal distribution of work across available threads,
/// batch size is automatically calculated based on the number of workers
/// in the executor and the total number of individuals to evaluate:
///
/// ```text
/// batch_size = (total_individuals + num_workers - 1) / num_workers
/// ```
/// So, for example, if you have 100 individuals and 4 workers, the batch size would be:
///
/// ```text
/// batch_size = (100 + 4 - 1) / 4 = 25
/// ```
///
/// But, if your executor is [Executor::Serial], then the batch size will simply be the total number of
/// individuals to evaluate, resulting in a single batch.

/// # Algorithm
///
/// The algorithm largely follows the same steps as `FitnessEvaluator`:
/// 1. **Collect Unevaluated Individuals**: Find individuals without fitness scores
/// 2. **Calculate Batch Size**: Determine optimal batch size based on worker count
/// 3. **Create Batches**: Group individuals into batches for parallel processing
/// 4. **Execute Batches**: Run batch evaluations through the executor
/// 5. **Update Ecosystem**: Store computed scores and restore genotypes
///
/// # Batch Size Optimization
///
/// The batch size is calculated to ensure optimal work distribution:
/// - **Small Batches**: Ensure all workers have work to do
/// - **Large Batches**: Minimize overhead from job creation and distribution
/// - **Balanced Distribution**: Work is evenly distributed across available threads
///
/// # Performance Optimizations
///
/// - **Efficient Batching**: Batches are created with minimal memory allocation
/// - **Parallel Execution**: Multiple batches are processed simultaneously
/// - **Memory Management**: Genotypes are efficiently restored after evaluation
