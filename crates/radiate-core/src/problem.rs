//! # Problem Abstraction
//!
//! This module provides the core problem abstraction for genetic algorithms, defining
//! how genotypes are encoded, decoded, and evaluated. The [Problem] trait serves as
//! the central interface that combines encoding/decoding logic with fitness evaluation,
//! making it easy to implement custom problems while maintaining a consistent API.
//!
//! The module provides both the trait definition and concrete implementations:
//! - **Problem trait**: Core interface for genetic algorithm problems
//! - **EngineProblem**: Standard implementation using individual fitness functions
//! - **BatchEngineProblem**: Optimized implementation for batch fitness evaluation

/// The core interface for genetic algorithm problems.
///
/// The [Problem] trait encapsulates the three essential components of a genetic
/// algorithm: encoding, decoding, and fitness evaluation. It provides a unified
/// interface that allows the engine to work with any problem implementation
/// without needing to understand the specific details of how genotypes are
/// represented or how fitness is calculated.
///
/// # Generic Parameters
///
/// - `C`: The chromosome type that represents the genetic material
/// - `T`: The phenotype type that represents the decoded individual
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// All problems must be `Send + Sync` to support parallel execution across
/// multiple threads. This ensures safe sharing of problems between worker threads
/// during fitness evaluation.
///
/// # Performance Considerations
///
/// - **Encoding**: Called sparingly, so performance is less critical
/// - **Decoding**: Called frequently during evaluation, should be optimized
/// - **Fitness Evaluation**: Debatably the most computationally expensive operation across all problem types
pub trait Problem<C: Chromosome, T>: Send + Sync {
    /// Creates a new [Genotype] representing the initial state of the problem.
    /// The returned [Genotype] should represent a valid starting point for evolution.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// A [Genotype] that can be used as a starting point for evolution
    ///

    ///

    /// population has sufficient genetic diversity for effective evolution.

    /// be deterministic and efficient, as it's called frequently during
    /// fitness evaluation.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * [Genotype] - The genotype to decode
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// The decoded phenotype that can be evaluated
    ///
    /// # Performance
    ///

    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `individual` - The [Genotype] to evaluate
    ///

    ///
    /// A fitness score representing the quality of the individual

    /// Evaluates the fitness of multiple individuals in a batch.
    ///
    /// This method provides an efficient way to evaluate multiple individuals
    /// at once, which can be more efficient than calling `eval` multiple times,
    /// especially when the fitness function can benefit from vectorization,
    /// when there are significant overhead costs per evaluation, or when you need
    /// access to parts, or the whole, of the population to make informed decisions.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `individuals` - A slice of genotypes to evaluate
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// A vector of fitness scores, one for each individual
    ///
    /// # Default Implementation
    ///
    /// The default implementation simply calls `eval` for each individual.
    /// Override this method if you can provide a more efficient batch
    /// evaluation strategy.

///
/// - `C`: The [Chromosome] type that represents the genetic material

/// // Create a simple fitness function
/// let fitness_fn = Arc::new(|phenotype: Vec<f32>| {

/// # Thread Safety
///
/// This struct is marked as `Send + Sync` to ensure it can be safely shared

///
/// # Performance Characteristics
///
/// - **Individual Evaluation**: Each individual is evaluated separately

/// - **Flexibility**: Easy to implement custom fitness logic
/// - **Parallelization**: Can utilize multiple threads through the executor
