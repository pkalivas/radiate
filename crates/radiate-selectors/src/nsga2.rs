/// Individuals are then selected based on their rank and crowding distance.
/// The crowding distance is a measure of how close an individual is to its
/// neighbors in the objective space. Individuals with a higher crowding distance
/// are more desirable because they are more spread out. This is useful for selecting
/// diverse solutions in a multi-objective optimization problem. It uses 'fast non-dominated sorting'
