# Alterers

Alterers are the operators that modify the population of individuals through either mutation or crossover. Crossover and mutation are two powerful ways to create new individuals from the existing population, and they are essential for the genetic algorithm to explore the search space effectively.
As such, the choice of alterer can have a significant impact on the performance of the genetic algorithm, so it is important to choose an alterer that is well-suited to the problem being solved.

Radiate defines an alterer as:

## Crossover 

Crossover is a genetic operator that combines two parent individuals to create one or more offspring. Radiate provides a number of built-in crossover operators that can be used to customize the crossover process, or you can define your own custom crossover operators.
