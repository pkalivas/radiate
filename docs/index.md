Radiate is a powerful library for implementing genetic algorithms and artificial evolution techniques. It provides a fast and flexible framework for creating, evolving, and optimizing solutions to complex problems using principles
inspired by natural selection and genetics. The core is written in Rust and is available for Python.

-   **Ease of use** :material-thumb-up:{ .right }

    ---

    Intuitive API design allows users to easily configure and run genetic algorithms without needed to know the nuts and bolts of the complex operations underlying them.

-   **Modular Design** :material-draw:{ .right }

    ---

    The library architecture enables users to mix and match different components such as selection strategies, crossover methods, and mutation techniques to suit their specific needs.

-   **Performance** :material-rocket-launch:{ .right }

    ---

    Between Rust's performance capabilities, a multi-threaded architecture, and hours spent optimizing code, Radiate ensures efficient execution of genetic operations, even for large populations and complex problem spaces. 

-   **Flexibility** :material-domain:{ .right }

    ---

    Out of the box support for a customizable genotypes and fitness functions, Radiate can be adapted to a wide range of problem domains, from single and multi optimization tasks to neuroevolution and machine learning applications.
