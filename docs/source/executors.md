# Executors

---

During the process of evolution, various operations are pushed into an `executor` to be run. Things like evaluating fitness, dispatching events, etc. Executors are responsible for managing how these operations are run, whether that be in a single thread or multiple threads and how those threads are managed.

Currently, radiate supports three executors:

- `Serial`: Runs all operations in the main thread, one at a time.
    * This is the default executor if none is specified.
- `WorkerPool`: Uses a [rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon/tree/main) thread pool to run operations concurrently.
    * note that in rust this requires the `rayon` feature to be enabled in `Cargo.toml`. Python includes this by default.
- `FixedSizedWorkerPool(num_threads)`: Uses an internal thread pool with a fixed number of threads to run operations concurrently.

## Example

Continuing with our example from the preious sections - evolving a simple function: finding the best values for `y = ax + b` where we want to find optimal values for `a` and `b`. We'll keep the previous inputs the same as before, but now we add an `executor` to the `GeneticEngine`.

    ```python
    import radiate as rd

    # Define a fitness function that uses the decoded values
    def fitness_function(individual: list[float]) -> float:    
        # Calculate how well these parameters fit your data
        a = individual[0]
        b = individual[1]
        return calculate_error(a, b)  # Your error calculation here

    # Create a codec for two parameters (a and b)
    codec = rd.FloatCodec.vector(
        length=2,                   # We need two parameters: a and b
        value_range=(-1.0, 1.0),    # Start with values between -1 and 1
        bound_range=(-10.0, 10.0)   # Allow evolution to modify the values between -10 and 10
    )

    # Use Boltzmann selection for offspring - individuals which
    # will be used to create new individuals through mutation and crossover
    offspring_selector = rd.BoltzmannSelector(temp=4)

    # Use tournament selection for survivors - individuals which will 
    # be passed down unchanged to the next generation
    survivor_selector = rd.TournamentSelector(k=3)

	# Define the alterers - these will be applied to the selected offspring
	# to create new individuals. They will be applied in the order they are defined.
	alters = [
		rd.GaussianMutator(rate=0.1),
		rd.BlendCrossover(rate=0.8, alpha=0.5)
	]

    # Define the diversity measure
    diversity = rd.HammingDistance()  # or rd.EuclideanDistance() for continuous problems

    # Define the executor - here we use a fixed size worker pool with 4 threads
    executor = rd.Executor.FixedSizedWorkerPool(num_workers=4)
    # Alternatively, you can use a WorkerPool (which uses rayon's global thread pool)
    executor = rd.Executor.WorkerPool()
    # Or for single-threaded execution, use Serial - this is the default if none is specified
    executor = rd.Executor.Serial()

    # Create the evolution engine
    engine = rd.GeneticEngine(
        codec=codec,
        fitness_func=fitness_function,
        offspring_selector=offspring_selector,
        survivor_selector=survivor_selector,
		alters=alters,
        diversity=diversity,
        species_threshold=0.5,
        max_species_age=20,
        executor=executor,  # Set the executor here
        # ... other parameters ...
    )

    # Run the engine
    result = engine.run([rd.ScoreLimit(0.01), rd.GenerationsLimit(1000)])
    ```

=== ":fontawesome-brands-rust: Rust"

    To use the `WorkerPool` executor in rust (which uses rayon), ensure you have the `rayon` feature enabled in your `Cargo.toml`:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    radiate = { version = "x", features = ["rayon"] }
    ```

    ```rust
    use radiate::*;

    // Define a fitness function that uses the decoded values
    fn fitness_fn(individual: Vec<f32>) -> f32 {
        let a = individual[0];
        let b = individual[1];
        calculate_error(a, b)  // Your error calculation here
    }

    // This will produce a Genotype<FloatChromosome> with 1 FloatChromosome which
    // holds 2 FloatGenes (a and b), each with a value between -1.0 and 1.0 and a bound between -10.0 and 10.0
    let codec = FloatCodec::vector(2, -1.0..1.0).with_bounds(-10.0..10.0);

    // Use Boltzmann selection for offspring - individuals which
    // will be used to create new individuals through mutation and crossover
    let offspring_selector = BoltzmannSelector::new(4.0);

    // Use tournament selection for survivors - individuals which will
    // be passed down unchanged to the next generation
    let survivor_selector = TournamentSelector::new(3);

    // Define some alters 
	let alters = alters![
		GaussianMutator::new(0.1),
		BlendCrossover::new(0.8, 0.5)
	];

    // Define the diversity measure
    let diversity = HammingDistance::new(); // or EuclideanDistance::new() for continuous problems

    // Define the executor - here we use a fixed size worker pool with 4 threads
    let executor = Executor::FixedSizedWorkerPool(4);
    // Alternatively, you can use a WorkerPool (which uses rayon's global thread pool)
    let executor = Executor::WorkerPool;
    // Or for single-threaded execution, use Serial - this is the default if none is specified
    let executor = Executor::Serial;

    let mut engine = GeneticEngine::builder()
        .codec(codec)
        .offspring_selector(offspring_selector)
        .survivor_selector(survivor_selector)
        .fitness_fn(fitness_fn)
		.alterers(alters) 
        .diversity(diversity)  
        .species_threshold(0.5)     
        .max_species_age(20)        
        .executor(executor)         // Set the executor here
        // ... other parameters ...
        .build();

    // Run the engine
    let result = engine.run(|generation| {
        // Now because we have added diversity, the ecosystem will include species like such:
        let species = generation.species().unwrap();
        println!("Species count: {}", species.len());
        generation.index() >= 1000 || generation.score().as_f32() <= 0.01
    });
    ```
