# Understanding the Genome System

## Introduction

In genetic algorithms, we need a way to represent and manipulate potential solutions to our problems. Radiate uses a genome system that breaks down genetic information into several key components. Think of it like a blueprint for building solutions, where each component has a specific role in creating and evolving individuals.

## The Building Blocks

---

### Allele

> The basic unit.

The `allele` is the smallest unit of genetic information in Radiate. It is a single value that can be used to represent a trait or characteristic of an individual. For example, an `allele` could represent a single bit in a binary string, a single character in a string, or a single number in a list of numbers. At its most basic level, an `allele` is the "atom" of genetic information that is used to express the genetic makeup of an individual - think of it as the "letter" in a genetic "word". For example, it could be:

- A number (like `42` or `3.14`)
- A character (like `A` or `?`)
- A boolean value (`true`/`false`)
- Any other basic value type

---

### Gene

> The container.

A `Gene` is a wrapper around an `allele` that adds functionality which is compatible with the genetic algorithm. It's like a container that not only holds the value, or `allele`, but also knows how to:

- Create new instances of itself
- Validate itself and its `allele`
- Perform operations on its `allele` like addition, subtraction, or mutation
- Maintain constraints (like value ranges)

Certain `Genes` have additional functionality that allows them to be manipulated in specific ways, such as the `FloatGene` and `IntGene<I>` which implement the `ArithmeticGene`. The `ArithmeticGene` trait provides methods for performing arithmetic operations on the `Gene`. Radiate provides several built-in gene types, however, you can also create custom genes to suit your specific needs. The core built-in genes include:

??? info "FloatGene"

    For evolving floating-point numbers. If the `allele` is not specified, it will be randomly initialized within the `value_range`. If the `value_range` is not specified, it will default to (`-1e10`, `1e10`). If the `bound_range` is not specified, it will default to `value_range`.

    === ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

        ```python
        import radiate as rd

        # Create a float gene that can evolve between -1.0 and 1.0 but 
        # must stay within -10.0 to 10.0 during evolution
        gene = rd.Gene.float(
            allele=0.5,                   # Current value
            value_range=(-1.0, 1.0),      # Initial range
            bound_range=(-10.0, 10.0)     # Evolution bounds
        )
        ```

    === ":fontawesome-brands-rust: Rust"

        ```rust
        use radiate::*;

        // Create a float gene that can evolve between -1.0 and 1.0 but 
        // must stay within -10.0 to 10.0 during evolution
        let gene = FloatGene::new(0.5, -1.0..1.0, -10.0..10.0);

        // Create a float gene with a randomly generated allele between -1.0 and 1.0
        // and bounds between -1.0 and 1.0
        let gene = FloatGene::from(-1.0..1.0)

        // Create a float gene with a randomly generated allele between -1.0 and 1.0 with bounds between -10.0 and 10.0
        let gene = FloatGene::from(-1.0..1.0, -10.0..10.0);

        // Create a float gene with an allele of 0.5 allele between -1.0 and 1.0 with bounds between -10.0 and 10.0
        let gene = FloatGene::from((0.5, -1.0..1.0, -10.0..10.0));
        ```


??? info "IntGene"

    For evolving integer values. If the `allele` is not specified, it will be randomly initialized within the `value_range`. If the `value_range` is not specified, it will default to (`-1e10`, `1e10`). If the `bound_range` is not specified, it will default to `value_range`. The `IntGene` holds a generic type `I` that implements the `Integer<I>` trait, which allows it to work with various integer types such as `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, and `u128`.

    === ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

        ```python
        import radiate as rd

        # Create an integer gene that can evolve between -100 and 100
        gene = rd.Gene.int(
            allele=42,                     # Current value
            value_range=(-10, 10),        # Initial range
            bound_range=(-100, 100)       # Evolution bounds
        )
        ```

    === ":fontawesome-brands-rust: Rust"

        ```rust
        use radiate::*;

        // Create an integer gene that can evolve between -100 and 100
        let gene = IntGene::new(42, -10..10, -100..100);

        // Create an integer gene with a randomly generated allele between -10 and 10 - specify the int type
        let gene = IntGene::<i8>::from(-10..10);

        // Create an integer gene with a randomly generated allele between -10 and 10 with bounds between -100 and 100
        let gene = IntGene::from(-10..10, -100..100);

        // Create an integer gene with an allele of 42 between -10 and 10 with bounds between -100 and 100
        let gene = IntGene::from((42, -10..10, -100..100));
        ``` 

??? info "BitGene"

    For evolving binary values. Radiate uses a `bool` as the allele for `BitGene`, which can be either `True` or `False`. 

    === ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

        ```python
        import radiate as rd

        # Create an bit gene with an allele of True - if the allele isn't specified, it will 
        # be randomly initialized to True or False
        gene = rd.Gene.bool(allele=True)
        ```

    === ":fontawesome-brands-rust: Rust"

        ```rust
        use radiate::*;

        // Create an bit gene with a randomly generated allele of true or false.
        let gene = BitGene::new();

        // Create a bit gene with an allele of true
        let gene = BitGene::from(true); 
        ```

??? info "CharGene"

    For evolving character values. The `CharGene` uses a `char` as its allele, which can represent any single Unicode character. If the `allele` is not specified, it will be randomly initialized to a character within the specified `char_set`. If the `char_set` is not specified, it will default to the ASCII printable characters.

    === ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

        ```python
        import radiate as rd

        # Create a character gene with an allele of 'A'
        gene = rd.Gene.char(allele='A')

        # Create a character gene with a randomly generated allele from the set 'abc'
        gene = rd.Gene.char(char_set='abc')  
        ```

    === ":fontawesome-brands-rust: Rust"

        ```rust
        use radiate::*;

        // Create an char gene with a randomly generated allele from the ASCII printable characters
        let gene = CharGene::default();

        // Create a char gene with a char_set of 'abc' of which the allele will be randomly chosen from
        let gene = CharGene::from("abc");
        ```

??? info "PermutationGene"

    For evolving permutations of a set of values. The `PermutationGene` allows you to represent a single value from a list of unique values. It is useful for problems where the order of elements matters, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem.

    === ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

        !!! warning ":construction: Under Construction :construction:"

            This Gene is currently under construction and not yet available in the Python API.

    === ":fontawesome-brands-rust: Rust"

        ```rust
        use radiate::*;

        // Define a list of alleles the associated genes
        let alleles = Arc::new(vec![1, 2, 3, 4]);
        let genes = vec![
            PermutationGene::new(0, Arc::clone(&alleles)),
            PermutationGene::new(1, Arc::clone(&alleles)),
            PermutationGene::new(2, Arc::clone(&alleles)),
            PermutationGene::new(3, Arc::clone(&alleles)),
        ];
        ```

### Chromosome

> The Collection.

Each `Gene` is contained within a `Chromosome` and as such, each `Gene` has its own `Chromosome`.
The `Chromosome` is a collection of `Genes` that represent a part or the whole of the genetic information of an individual. A `Chromosome` can be thought of as a "chunk" or vector of genetic information. For example, a `Chromosome` could represent a sequence of numbers, a string of characters, or a set of binary values among other things. The decision to define a `Chromosome` for each `Gene` was made to allow for more flexibility in the genetic information that can be represented. Think of it as a "sentence" made up of multiple "words" (genes). Each chromosome represents a specific part of your solution.

For example, if you're evolving a neural network, you might have:

- One chromosome for the weights of the first layer
- Another chromosome for the weights of the second layer
- Each chromosome contains multiple genes (the individual weights)

Because each `Chromosome` has an associated `Gene`, the built int chromosomes are defined as follows:

??? info "FloatChromosome"

    For evolving a sequence of floating-point numbers. It contains a vector of `FloatGene` instances.

    === ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

        ```python
        import radiate as rd

        # Create a float chromosome with 5 genes, each initialized to a random value between -1.0 and 1.0
        chromosome = rd.Chromosome.float(
            length=5, 
            value_range=(-1.0, 1.0), 
            bound_range=(-10.0, 10.0)
        )
        ```

    === ":fontawesome-brands-rust: Rust"

        ```rust
        use radiate::*;

        // Create a float chromosome with 5 genes, each initialized to a random value between -1.0 and 1.0
        let chromosome = FloatChromosome::from((5, -1.0..1.0));

        let bounded_chromosome = FloatChromosome::from((5, -1.0..1.0, -10.0..10.0));
        ```

??? info "IntChromosome"

    For evolving a sequence of integer values. It contains a vector of `IntGene<I>` instances, where `I` is a generic type that implements the `Integer<I>` trait.

    === ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

        ```python
        import radiate as rd

        # Create an integer chromosome with 5 genes, each initialized to a random value between -10 and 10

            length=5, 
            value_range=(-10, 10), 
            bound_range=(-100, 100)
        )
        ```

    === ":fontawesome-brands-rust: Rust"

        ```rust
        use radiate::*;

        // Create an integer chromosome with 5 genes, each initialized to a random value between -10 and 10
        let chromosome = IntChromosome::<i32>::from((5, -10..10));

        let bounded_chromosome = IntChromosome::<i32>::from((5, -10..10, -100..100));
        ```

??? info "BitChromosome"

    For evolving a sequence of binary values. It contains a vector of `BitGene` instances.

    === ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

        ```python
        import radiate as rd

        # Create a bit chromosome with 5 genes, each initialized to a random value of True or False

        ```

    === ":fontawesome-brands-rust: Rust"

        chromosome_with_set = rd.Chromosome.char(length=5, char_set='abc')
        ```

    === ":fontawesome-brands-rust: Rust"

        ```rust
        use radiate::*;

        // Create a character chromosome with 5 genes, each initialized to
        // a random character from the provided char_set
        let chromosome = CharChromosome::new((5, vec!['a', 'b', 'c']));
        let chromosome_with_set = CharChromosome::from((5, "abc"));
        ```

??? info "PermutationChromosome<T>"

    For evolving a sequence of unique values. It contains a vector of `PermutationGene<T>` instances, where `T` is the type of the values in the permutation.

    === ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

        ```

### Genotype

> The Complete Blueprint

The `Genotype` is a collection of `Chromosomes` that represent the complete genetic makeup of an individual. A `Genotype` can be thought of as a "blueprint" for an individual that contains all of the genetic information necessary to fully express the traits and characteristics of that individual.  In essance, the `Genotype` is the "sentence" made up of multiple "words" (chromosomes). Each `Genotype` contains one or more `Chromosomes`, and each `Chromosome` contains one or more `Genes`. It is the "DNA" of the individual that the `GeneticEngine` is evolving.

Because of the typed nature of the `Genotype`, it can only hold a collection of the same type of `Chromosome`. This means that you can have a `Genotype` that contains only `FloatChromosome`s, or only `IntChromosome`s. You cannot have a `Genotype` that contains both `FloatChromosome`s and `IntChromosome`s at the same time - this is by design.

=== ":fontawesome-brands-python: Python"

    ```python
    import radiate as rd

    # Create a genotype with a single FloatChromosome and a 5 FloatGenes
    genotype = rd.Genotype(
        rd.Chromosome.float(length=5, value_range=(-1.0, 1.0))
    )

    # Create a genotype with a single FloatChromosome and a single FloatGene with a 
    # randomly generated allele between -1.0 and 1.0
    genotype = rd.Genotype(
        rd.Chromosome.float(genes=rd.Gene.float(value_range=(-1.0, 1.0)))
    )

    # Create a genotype with multiple chromosomes of lengths 5, 15, and 3
    three_chromosome_genotype = rd.Genotype([
        rd.Chromosome.float(length=5, value_range=(-1.0, 1.0)),
        rd.Chromosome.float(length=15, value_range=(-1.0, 1.0)),
        rd.Chromosome.float(length=3, value_range=(-1.0, 1.0))
    ])
    ```

=== ":fontawesome-brands-rust: Rust"

    ```rust
    use radiate::*;

    // Create a genotype with a single FloatChromosome and a 5 FloatGenes 
    let genotype = Genotype::from(vec![FloatChromosome::from((5, -1.0..1.0))]);
    // -- or --
    let genotype = Genotype::from(vec![FloatChromosome::new(vec![FloatGene::new(0.1, -1.0..1.0)])]);

    // Create a genotype with multiple chromosomes of lengths 5, 15, and 3
    let three_chromosome_genotype = Genotype::new(vec![
        FloatChromosome::from((5, -1.0..1.0)),
        FloatChromosome::from((15, -1.0..1.0)),
        FloatChromosome::from((3, -1.0..1.0))
    ])

    let genotype_length = three_chromosome_genotype.len(); // 3

    // Get the second chromosome from the genotype
    let second_chromosome = three_chromosome_genotype.get(1).unwrap(); // or use `three_chromosome_genotype[1]`
    let mut second_chromosome_mut = three_chromosome_genotype.get_mut(1).unwrap();

    for chromosome in three_chromosome_genotype.iter() { // or iter_mut()
        // Do something with each chromosome
    }
    ```

### Phenotype

> The Living Solution

The `Phenotype` is the representation of an individual in the population that is being evolved by the `GeneticEngine`. It is a concrete implementation of a `Genotype` that includes additional functionality for the individual, such as calculating its fitness score. The `Phenotype` is the "living" version of the `Genotype`, and it is what the `GeneticEngine` interacts with during the evolution process.

The `Phenotype` is responsible for:

- Providing a way for the `GeneticEngine` to interact with the individual
- Holding the genetic information of the individual, including its `Genotype` and fitness or `score`
- Managing the individual's state during the evolution process

You shouldn't need to create a `Phenotype` directly, as the `GeneticEngine` will handle this for you.

---

### Population

> The Community

The `Population` is a collection of `Phenotype`s that represent the current state of the genetic algorithm. It is the "community" of solutions that the `GeneticEngine` is evolving. Its really just a vector of `Phenotype`s. The `Population` is responsible for:

- Sorting individuals based on their fitness scores
- Holding the current individuals that are being evolved
- Providing a way for the `GeneticEngine` to interact with the individuals being evolved

The `Population` is created and managed by the `GeneticEngine`, and you shouldn't need to create a `Population` directly. Instead, you will interact with the `GeneticEngine` to manage the population and evolve the individuals.

---
### Species

> The Diverse Groups

The `Species` is an optional component of the genome system that contains a `Population` of `Phenotype`s that are similar to each other. It is used to group individuals that are similar in some way, such as having similar `Genotype` structures or fitness scores. The `Species` is responsible for:

- Grouping individuals that are similar to each other
- Allowing the `GeneticEngine` to evolve individuals within a specific group
- Providing a way to manage diversity within the population
- Sharing fitness information between individuals in the same species

The `Species` is not required for the genome system to function, but it can be useful for certain types of problems where grouping similar individuals can help improve the evolution process. For different `Species` to be created, your `GeneticEngine` must contain a struct which implements the `Diversity` trait - this will allow the `GeneticEngine` to create and manage `Species` based on the diversity of the individuals in the population. More on this later.

---
### Ecosystem

> The Environment

The `Ecosystem` is the highest level of the genome system and represents the entire environment in which the genetic algorithm operates. It contains zero to many `Species`, each with its own `Population` of `Phenotype`s, and a single `Population` containing all `Phenotype`s. The `Ecosystem` is responsible for:

- Wrapping the entire genetic algorithm environment
- Managing the overall population of individuals
- Optionally Coordinating the interactions between different `Species` and managing their diversity

The `Ecosystem` is created and managed by the `GeneticEngine`, and you shouldn't need to create an `Ecosystem` directly. Instead, you will interact with the `GeneticEngine` to manage the ecosystem and evolve the individuals within it.

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the Right Gene Type**:
    - Use `FloatGene` for continuous values
    - Use `IntGene` for discrete values
    - Use `BitGene` for binary choices
    - Use `CharGene` for character-based problems
    - Use `PermutationGene` for ordered sets

2. **Structure Your Chromosomes**:
    - Keep chromosomes focused on specific aspects of your solution
    - Consider using multiple chromosomes for complex problems

3. **Design Your Genotype**:
    - Make sure it can represent all possible solutions
    - Keep it as simple as possible

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Overly Complex Genotypes**:
    - Don't make your genotype more complex than necessary
    - Start simple and add complexity only when needed

2. **Poor Gene Constraints**:
    - Always set appropriate value ranges and bounds
    <!-- - Consider the impact of constraints on evolution -->

## Summary
The genome system in Radiate provides a structured way to represent and manipulate genetic information. By understanding the components of the genome system, you can effectively design and evolve solutions to complex problems using genetic algorithms. The key components include:

- **Allele**: The basic unit of genetic information.
- **Gene**: A container for an allele with additional functionality.
- **Chromosome**: A collection of genes that represent a part or the whole of the genetic information of an individual.
- **Genotype**: A collection of chromosomes that represent the complete genetic makeup of an individual.
- **Phenotype**: The representation of an individual in the population that holds additional information like fitness scores.
- **Population**: A collection of phenotypes that represent the current group being evolved
- **Species**: An optional grouping of similar phenotypes to manage diversity.
- **Ecosystem**: The highest level that wraps the entire genetic algorithm environment.
